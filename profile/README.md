# Welcome, future Khalanian
Khalani is an intent-driven blockchain with a native coordination stack that powers truly user-aligned applications.

Khalani is built around the idea that users should be empowered to **focus on outcomes, not execution paths.** Tell Khalani what you want. Khalani gets it done — any chain, any use case, any time. 



# Arcadia Intents Protocol
Khalani's first production-ready protocol for multi-chain, multi-agent coordination is the EVM-native **Arcadia Intents Protocol** (AIP) running on **Khalani Arcadia**. 

Arcadia is Khalani's first production mainnet.

From an application or end-user perspective, AIP serves as a Universal Intent Aggregator, or the “everything aggregator.” Wallets, dApps, and AI agents simply state desired outcomes, while the protocol orchestrates routing, liquidity, and proof services behind the scenes.

From a solver or service-provider perspective, the same infrastructure appears as an open, expertise-driven marketplace: routing specialists, liquidity providers, proof systems, and data oracles subscribe to intent streams and compete for fees on transparent, level terms.
